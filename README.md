This repository has notebooks with Machine learning tutorials for beginners. 

**./keras_mlp**: MultiLayer Perceptron for regression. \
**./sklearn** and **./sklearn2**: sklearn models for regression. \
**./sentiment**: different models for text classification or sentiment analysis. 

The data for codes in **./sentiment** will be sent upon request. I cannot share it because of twitter/X current restrictions.
