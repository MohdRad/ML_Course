This repository has notebooks with Machine learning tutorials for beginners. 

**./keras_mlp**: MultiLayer Perceptron for regression. \

**./sklearn** and **./sklearn2**: sklearn models for regression. \

**./sentiment**: different models for text classification or sentiment analysis. The data for codes in **./sentiment** will be sent upon request. I cannot share it because of twitter/X current restrictions. \

**./active_learning**: A tutorial to show how to use active learning for a regression problem using Gaussian Process Regressor (GPR). [`modAL`](https://modal-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is an active learning package. Installing it on anaconda using pip has issues so I include it locally.
